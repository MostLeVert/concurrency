# Convert Currency

Easy convert currencies in the browser; just select the currency you'd like to convert (including the currency symbol), right click and select convert to default.

Change your default currency in settings.

If you do not have a symbol on the web page, open the extension and perform the conversion from there, selecting your currency of choice.
